create an calender.component.jsx with FullCalender. To allow clients to choose time
 slots for personal training sessions, you can add event listeners to the calendar 
 that enable users to select specific dates and times. Once a user has selected a 
 time slot, you can use JavaScript to send an email and SMS to the trainer with 
 the client's information and the chosen time slot.
Here's an example of what the calendar.component.jsx file might look like
 using the FullCalendar library:


import React, { useState } from 'react';
import FullCalendar from '@fullcalendar/react';
import dayGridPlugin from '@fullcalendar/daygrid';
import interactionPlugin from '@fullcalendar/interaction';
import { sendEmail, sendSMS } from './notification.js';

const Calendar = () => {
  const [selectedEvent, setSelectedEvent] = useState(null);

  const handleDateClick = (info) => {
    setSelectedEvent(info);
  }

  const handleEventClick = (info) => {
    setSelectedEvent(info.event);
  }

  const handleEventClick = (info) => {
    setSelectedEvent(info.event);
  }

  const handleEventClick = (info) => {
    setSelectedEvent(info.event);
  }

  const handleSubmit = () => {
    if (!selectedEvent) {
      return;
    }

    // send an email and sms to the trainer with the client's information and the chosen time slot
    sendEmail(selectedEvent.clientEmail, selectedEvent.clientName, selectedEvent.timeSlot);
    sendSMS(selectedEvent.clientPhone, selectedEvent.clientName, selectedEvent.timeSlot);

    // reset the selected event
    setSelectedEvent(null);
  }

  return (
    <div>
      <FullCalendar
        plugins={[dayGridPlugin, interactionPlugin]}
        selectable={true}
        dateClick={handleDateClick}
        eventClick={handleEventClick}
        events={[
          { title: 'Training Session', start: '2022-04-01T10:00:00' },
          { title: 'Training Session', start: '2022-04-02T10:00:00' },
          { title: 'Training Session', start: '2022-04-03T10:00:00' },
        ]}
      />
      {selectedEvent && (
        <div>
          <h2>{selectedEvent.title}</h2>
          <form>
            <label>Client Name:</label>
<input type="text" placeholder="Enter client name" required/>
<label>Client Email:</label>
<input type="email" placeholder="Enter client email" required/>
<label>Client Phone:</label>
<input type="text" placeholder="Enter client phone" required/>
<button type="button" onClick={handleSubmit}>Submit</button>
</form>
</div>
)}
</div>
);
};

export default Calendar;

To integrate FullCalendar into your React application, you can install the react-fullcalendar package by running npm install react-fullcalendar in your terminal. Once installed, you can import the package into your calendar component and use it to render the calendar on your page.

You will also need to import the necessary CSS files for the calendar to be styled correctly. You can do this by adding the following line to the top of your calendar component file: import "react-fullcalendar/dist/css/react-fullcalendar.css";

Once you have imported the package and the necessary CSS, you can use the <FullCalendar> component in your JSX to render the calendar on your page. You will also need to pass in props such as the events that will be displayed on the calendar and the options for the calendar such as the default view and the timezone.

To enable users to select time slots, you can add event listeners to the calendar such as selectable and select. These listeners will allow the user to select specific dates and times on the calendar, and you can then use JavaScript to send an email and SMS to the trainer with the client's information and the chosen time slot.

You will also need to create a form where the client can enter their contact information, and create a function that will handle sending the email and SMS with the chosen time slot and client's contact information.

Here is an example of what your calendar component might look like:

Copy code
import React, { useState } from "react";
import FullCalendar from "react-fullcalendar";
import "react-fullcalendar/dist/css/react-fullcalendar.css";

function Calendar() {
  const [selectedDate, setSelectedDate] = useState(null);

  const handleSelect = (start, end) => {
    setSelectedDate({ start, end });
  };

  return (
    <div>
      <FullCalendar
        selectable
        events={[
          {
            title: "Event 1",
            start: "2020-01-01",
            end: "2020-01-02"
          },
          {
            title: "Event 2",
            start: "2020-01-05",
            end: "2020-01-07"
          }





To set up the calendar component, you will first need to install the FullCalendar
 package, which is available on npm. You can do this by running the following
  command in your project's root directory:


npm install fullcalendar
Then you can import the FullCalendar library into your calendar.component.jsx file:


import FullCalendar from 'fullcalendar';
Next, you will need to create a div in your component's JSX that the calendar will be rendered to. You can give this div an id or a class that you can reference later:


<div id="calendar"></div>
Now, you can initialize the calendar using the FullCalendar constructor, passing in options such as the calendar's selectable property, which allows users to select specific dates and times:

Copy code
componentDidMount() {
    const calendarEl = document.getElementById('calendar');
    const calendar = new FullCalendar.Calendar(calendarEl, {
        plugins: [ 'interaction', 'dayGrid', 'timeGrid' ],
        selectable: true,
        events: [
            //event data
        ]
    });
    calendar.render();
}
You can then add event listeners for when a user selects a date and time.
 Inside the event listener, you can use JavaScript to send an email and SMS
  using a library such as nodemailer and a Twilio API.

Copy code
calendar.on('select', (info) => {
    const start = info.startStr;
    const end = info.endStr;
    // send email and SMS
});
Please keep in mind that sending SMS messages or email require an account
 with these services, and the necessary credentials to connect to them.
